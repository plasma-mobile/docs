Plasma Phone Messaging

Mission Statement

Provide a user-friendly, Free and openly developed operating system for phones


Plasma Mobile: The plasmashell implementation and components specific for the handset formfactor (developer facing)

Plasma Phone: Fully integrated operating system running Plasma (user facing), includes Maliit, Kubuntu images, apps, kitchen sink, ...; a.k.a. "The Product"



Catch Phrases

- Something with KDE Evolve, "Infrastrukturwandel"


Development Process
- Code is developed within KDE Infrastructure, not behind closed doors
- Development is inclusive, people are welcome to join
- Kubuntu is used as reference implementation, other "platform contributions" are welcome and encouraged
- The project is governed by KDE / KDE e.V.
- mailing list to use: plasma-devel@kde.org

Status
- It's a _prototype_
- Development platform
- NOT end-user ready
